    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete based on the size of its input. An efficient algorithm is one that accomplishes its task with the least amount of time, making it favorable for large datasets. Time complexity is often expressed using Big O notation to describe the upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm's running time.

    <p>
        Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input. In algorithm analysis, we use Big O notation to describe the worst-case space requirements. An algorithm with space complexity O(n) means that the space required grows linearly with the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a crucial factor to consider, especially when working with constrained environments or dealing with large datasets.
